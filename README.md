# Subnautica Modding Site
The SNM (Abbreviation for "Subnautica Modding") site was originally built using the https://carrd.co/ website builder, and is now being transitioned to a self-coded website.

A site by RamuneNeptune, that is __not officially__ related to the Subnautica Modding discord server, but respected and known throughout the community.
SNM is used to provide users simple, good looking, and easy to follow guides for modding in Subnautica, as well as a few lists of Broken/Working mods, and an up to date list of BepInEx mods that work with te Subnautica 2.0 update.
